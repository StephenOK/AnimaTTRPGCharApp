    <string name = "sensoryIllusionDesc">The caster has the ability to lead a subject to believe whatever he wishes. Though the caster does not actually modify reality, his spell convinces an affected character that an illusion is so real, that he will react as if it were true in every aspect. For example, if an illusionist wants to trick somebody into thinking he has no legs or arms, the subject will lose all sense of his limbs and fall to the ground in the belief that he has, indeed, lost them. Another example of this could be a fighter suffering from wounds who is led to believe, not only that he is in perfect shape, but also that he possesses a +50 All Action Bonus. A character convinced that he is dead automatically lapses into unconsciousness. The MR of PsR Difficulty for resisting the spell is 120.

A character can resist the effects of this spell by passing a MR Check with a Difficulty of 120. Those subjects failing the check are entitled to repeat it every time they have reason to believe there is someone around.</string>

    <string name = "deceiveDeathDesc">A person affected by this spell cannot die; the Flow of Souls will ignore his presence and thus be unable to claim him.

    <string name = "lieWorld">World of Lies</string>
    <string name = "lieWorldDesc">This spell creates an artificial reality that the caster can modify as he pleases. He might create a city out of nowhere and turn it into a fantasy land in the next turn, for example. Imagination is the limit. This spell covers a one-kilometer radius within which all illusions have Ghostly Spell status. Everyone entering the spell\'s radius must pass a MR Check with a Difficulty of 140 or fall beneath the power of this spell. World of Lies also allows the caster to create unreal creatures to populate it. These creatures exist as illusions of a Ghostly nature. The caster has 100 levels at his disposal to distribute among these entities - although none of them can have more than half of their level rounded up. In other words, the caster may create one hundred 1st level Ghostly Beings, ten 5th level beings, and five 10th level beings, or any other possible combination. The entities are fashioned according to the caster\'s desires using the Beings Between Worlds rules in Chapter 26. These creatures have illusory intelligence and life; they are able to act independently following the orders given by their master. Those characters entering the area of influence and failing the Resistance Check can only repeat it when encountering doubts on the reality of their surroundings.</string>
    <string name = "lieWorldEff">+5 to MR Difficulty, +50 levels distributed among Beings, and double the area of coverage</string>

    <string name = "falseReality">False Reality</string>
    <string name = "falseRealityDesc">This spell creates a distorted reality and makes something fake real. In this way, events that can have never taken place can be invented and made to produce effects upon the present. History is not really altered, since the spell only manages to change the status of things at the time it is cast. However, few people are able to tell the difference. The spell cannot accomplish the impossible; it can only alter feasible events which are likely to happen if the appropriate situation is created by the caster./nFor example, the caster might say a certain mountain pass has been blocked due to a landslide caused by thieves making their escape. According to this, the False Reality spell would affect a random bunch of burglars and all individuals in the mountain pass at the time. Another example may be that the caster could claim that a non-existent entity, called Ethon, as about to destroy a city. He only needs to be able to justify the birth of the creature by saying, for instance, that it was created by a powerful sorcerer in the past. It is all up to the creativity he puts into the lie.\nUtilizing MR Checks for this spell is hard to do. It is necessary to find the being or object with the highest Resistance introduced "within the lie" or affected by it. In the first of the examples above, the burglars would make the MR Check. However, if a high-level individual crossed the pass at the time, he would use his Magic Resistance instead of the thieves. In the second example, a sorcerer powerful enough to create Ethon would be the one who do the check. Whoever he is, the chosen individual may resist (disbelieve) this spell with a MR Check with a base Difficulty of 120. The GM can adjust this Difficulty depending on the nature of the False Reality created. Extremely absurd events or circumstances should be easier to disbelieve.</string>
