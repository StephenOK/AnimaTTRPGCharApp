They also receive a MR Check each day.\nThis spell can also manipulate the bloodstream in living organisms. However, victims receive a +40 to their MR or PhR Check in such cases. Bloodstream manipulation allows the spellcaster to cause an All Action Penalty and damage per round equivalent to half the failure level.

    <string name = "liquidBodyDesc">This spell transforms a targeted body into a liquid substance immune to many types of attacks and susceptible to form shift at the spellcaster\'s will.

Furthermore, Impact attacks will have half their regular effect upon them - unless they can damage Energy, in which case they will still have full effect. Liquefied characters do, however, become vulnerable to paralyzing Cold effects, suffering a -20 penalty to Resistance Checks against them.

The effect automatically reflects upon the originator, who must pass a MR Check with a Difficulty of 120 in order to avoid falling victim to his own powers. For example, if a caster falls prey to a terrible pain of a magical nature, this spell would force the character who caused the pain to pass a MR Check or undergo the same suffering. This spell requires no maintenance; the reflected state will remain for as long as the original target continues to suffer the ill effects.

Whoever is trapped inside will move as if diving and will soon drown unless he is able to breathe in liquid environments.

However, characters receive a +1 bonus to their check for every Swim level above Easy that they pass. The water mass appears as a cube 10 meters wide and 10 meters high.

Although endowed with the capability of interacting with the real world, and visible to everyone, it is immune to non-Energy-based attacks. Powers of the original creature that depend on Gnosis higher than 25 cannot be duplicated. The reflection will obey the spellcaster\'s orders, but it can only materialize in the presence of the subject upon whose likeness it has been created. This spell can create a copy of anyone\'s soul, provided he has a Presence less than 40. Unwilling participants can attempt to resist the spell by passing a MR Check with a Difficulty of 140. The spell will not work upon the caster himself.\nIf a spellcaster uses Added Effects to increase the maximum affected Presence to 60, it will take two Added Effects to increase the maximum Presence by 5 thereafter.
