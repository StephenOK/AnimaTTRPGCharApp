    <string name = "natAffinity">Natural Affinity</string>
    <string name = "natAffinityDesc">This spell alters the essence of an individual, allowing him to bond with natural beings so that such beings recognize the individual as one of their own. For instance, this spell could be used to gain wolf affinity, so that wolves would recognize the character as an actual wolf. This spell can affect up to a total 60 Presence.</string>
    <string name = "natAffinityEff">+10 to the maximum Presence affected</string>

    <string name = "detectEssence">Detect Essence</string>
    <string name = "detectEssenceDesc">The spellcaster is able to detect any being\'s base essence in a 10-meter radius. The caster does not obtain real information about the creatures but is able to recognize its elemental bonding and is later able to identify beings with the same type of essence or race. Avoiding the effect requires passing a MR Check with a Difficulty of 100. The spellcaster needs some evidence of an entity\'s presence nearby in order to feel its essence. This spell can affect spiritual creatures invisible to the human eye.</string>

    <string name = "essenceCom">Communication Through Essence</string>
    <string name = "essenceComDesc">The spell establishes a connection between the caster and another living being, making it possible for them to communicate spiritually.

    <string name = "natKnowledge">Natural Knowledge</string>

    <string name = "healing">Healing</string>
    <string name = "healingDesc">This spell instantly heals one target creature by restoring up to 30% of lost LP. The spell cannot recover lost limbs, nor can it eliminate critical-based penalties, but it does stop all types of bleeding. Damage Resistance beings only recover half that percentage.</string>
    <string name = "healingEff">+5% Life Points</string>

    <string name = "soulBarrier">Soul Barrier</string>
    <string name = "soulBarrierDesc">This spell creates a barrier that stops all Spiritual attacks affecting supernatural Resistances. In other words, the shield can be used to stop attacks that would force the caster to roll for MR or PhR. It is not capable of stopping attacks that cause damage with added effects, such as Rain of Destruction. The shield itself does not have Life Points, since it does not protect against damaging impacts. The barrier cannot stop attacks that require a Resistance Check of 120 or higher.</string>

    <string name = "shareSense">Share Senses</string>

    <string name = "essenceMod">Modify Essence</string>
    <string name = "essenceModDesc">This spell allows the caster to modify his own, or another subject\'s, essence at will. The spell does not grant special abilities as part of the change, but it does temporarily alter the animistic base of the being. In this manner, the spell could turn an elemental\'s Earth essence into Cold, causing it to become particularly vulnerable to Heat-based effects and attacks. If the creature should possess powers exclusive to the elemental being modified, it temporarily loses those powers. To avoid this effect it is necessary to pass a MR Check with a Difficulty of 140.</string>
    <string name = "essenceModEff">+5 to MR Difficulty</string>

    <string name = "soulPoison">Soul Poison</string>
    <string name = "soulPoisonDesc">Soul Poison is a supernatural substance inoculated in the soul of the targeted individual which spreads through all of his body.

    <string name = "analyzeSoul">Analyze Soul</string>
    <string name = "analyzeSoulDesc">This spell allows the caster to spiritually scrutinize individuals or creatures, obtaining detailed information about their natural capacities and powers. Although the spell does not confer access to the subjects\' knowledge, or the level of the abilities that depend on it, the caster can measure their spiritual potential and its innate capabilities. For instance, when directed at a supernatural being, the caster will discover his powers and their level, but he will not be able to tell what the creature is able to do, or how good a fighter he is. The target may resist this spell with a MR Check of 120 Difficulty.</string>

    <string name = "acquireCapacitiesDesc">This spell grants the chance of acquiring the abilities and characteristics of existing plants or animals. It gives the target 50 extra DP to acquire secondary abilities, essential abilities, or powers described in Chapter 26. Only secondary abilities from the physical fields of Agility, Perception, and Strength, and only special powers with Gnosis 0 requirements can be chosen. DP are invested according to the character\'s class. Primary Abilities may not be increased with this spell, nor can supernatural abilities ba acquired. This spell can temporarily affect the target\'s physical appearance. For instance, a character acquiring an increased damage Natural Weapon might sprout horns. A character can only be affected by one Acquire Natural Capacities spell at a time.</string>

    <string name = "lifeMindDesc">This spell connects the caster\'s essence with any living organism with Gnosis 10 or lower, including plants and animals, within a 500-meter radius. The spell enables the spellcaster to sense the events surrounding the affected parties using their perception, but it will not enable him to exert any control upon them. Since the caster is also transmitting part of his spirit, he can cast spells through the connected target with half his usual MA. Any Spiritual spell cast upon the targeted organism will also affect the caster of Life Mind. The targeted organism can resist Life Mind by passing a MR with a Difficulty of 80. Once established as a guest in a specific body, the spellcaster can jump on to any subject in the radius of effect, provided the new target fails the Resistance. An individual passing the Check cannot be affected by the spell independently of the caster\'s attempts. Affected people do not usually realize they are being used even when spells are being cast through them. Anyone hosting the caster\'s essence who leaves the area of effect of Life Mind is freed from the caster\'s influence.\nThe caster may specifically target any appropriate organism within the spell\'s area of effect that he is aware of, but Life Mind cannot be used to detect the presence of living organisms. If the spellcaster has no obvious target, he can direct the power of the spell to simply join with the nearest appropriate target, if there is one. However, this method can be of very limited use, since it is quite possible the nearest living organism would be nothing more than a blade of grass.\nWhile this spell is in effect, the caster is not aware of events taking place around his true being.</string>

    <string name = "alterGrowth">Alter Growth</string>

Resisting the effect requires passing a MR with a Difficulty of 100. This spell is not capable of stopping the passage of time altogether, no matter how many added effects are employed; however, it can delay its effects considerably. For instance, in the case the spell is cast with five added effects to quicken aging, each new day will count as 64 days for the targeted individual.</string>
    <string name = "alterGrowthEff">Doubles or cuts in half the growth rate again and +5 to the maximum Presence affected</string>

Animals in Chapter 25 can be used as a reference.</string>

    <string name = "natureControlDesc">By means of this spell, the spellcaster gains absolute dominion over a single living thing with Gnosis 0. Valid targets include animals, plants, and even regular human beings. The caster transmits his orders directly through a mystical connection, without the need of language. Resisting the effects of the spell requires passing a MR with a Difficulty of 80. Psychic Resistance cannot be used for resisting the spell, since it\'s the subject\'s essence, and not its mind, that is being controlled. The target is entitled to a new check every day, and every time it receives an order completely against his nature. The target may receive a +20 bonus to the MR Check if given an extreme order, such as sacrificing its own life or slaying a loved one.</string>

    <string name = "flowReturnDesc">This spell sends a spirit back to the Flow of Souls. It can affect both dead souls awaiting The Calling and creatures of a spiritual nature.

    <string name = "shieldAreaDesc">This spell haunts a specific area making it impossible to be trespassed by certain beings. The spellcaster decides which beings\' access will be restricted, and there is no limit to the number of creatures he can choose. For instance, he could forbid the entrance of fire elementals, or only allow the entrance of humans. The affected area has a maximum 20-meter radius and remains stationary. Any forbidden creature that attempts to enter the shielded area must pass a MR Check with a Difficulty of 120. Creatures that fail the Check are entitled to a new roll each hour. Creatures already inside the area at the time the spell is cast can circulate freely and may leave the shielded area without hindrance, but once beyond the shielded area, they must pass a similar MR Check to re-enter the area.</string>

    <string name = "supernaturalControl">Supernatural Control</string>
    <string name = "supernaturalControlDesc">This spell grants total control of a spirit or a Being Between Worlds. The caster transmits his orders through the mystical connection directly, without the need of language or a mutual understanding. An entity wishing to resist the effects of this spell must pass a MR Check with a Difficulty of 80, and since it is the creature\'s essence that is under control, it cannot use its PsR. The victim is entitled to a new check every day and every time it receives an order completely against its nature.</string>

    <string name = "shareEssence">Share Essence</string>
    <string name = "shareEssenceDesc">The spellcaster ties the essence of two individuals together in an indivisible unity. In this way, all damage and spiritual effects suffered by one will affect the other. Both individuals use the highest MR of the two against Spiritual spells. When the essence of a regular being is tied to that of a Damage Resistance being, the former only suffers one-fifth of the damage received by the creature. The total of the Presences that can be affected cannot exceed 100. Resisting this spell requires a MR Check with a Difficulty of 120.</string>
    <string name = "shareEssenceEff">+5 to MR Difficulty and +10 to the maximum Presence affected</string>

    <string name = "transmigrateSoul">Transmigrate Soul</string>
    <string name = "transmigrateSoulDesc">This spell confers upon the caster the ability to transport any soul in his presence to a new host. The soul can be hosted in a living being, or an inanimate object such as a stone or a sword. A dead body, in good condition, can also serve as a host, in which case the body returns to life. The transmigrated soul adopts all the physical capabilities and limitations of the new host, retaining only its own intellectual, and possibly its animistic, capabilities. For example, if the new host is a tree, the soul will be able to think, but it will be unable to speak or move. Once the transmigration is complete, the soul remains with its new host until the host is destroyed.\nIf the soul transmigrates to a body, or object, already inhabited by another soul, the intruding soul will naturally meet resistance. The two souls engage in a struggle for dominion by each rolling 1d100 and adding their base Presence (no open rolls allowed); the highest total wins the struggle. If the difference between the two results is 100 or more, the winner consumes the other soul and takes control of the host permanently. If the difference is 50–99, the weaker soul is pacified and remains indefinitely asleep until something awakens it. If the difference is less than 50, the winner gains temporary control over the host, but the weaker soul remains awake and is entitles to a new check once per day.\nThis spell can affect souls with a maximum Presence of 60. Both the affected soul and the targeted host can attempt to resist this spell with a MR check of Difficulty 100. This spell can affect deceased spirits still awaiting the Calling, but it cannot bring back spirits from the Flow. Whenever a supernatural being is enclosed in a physical body, it may lose levels and animistic powers.</string>

    <string name = "spiritExist">Spiritual Existence</string>
    <string name = "spiritExistDesc">The caster is able to transcend into a spiritual state, forsaking his physical body forever. From that point on, he is no longer a Natural nor Being Between Worlds creature, instead becoming a Gnosis 25 spiritual entity, with all the benefits this implies. In addition, 150 extra Development Points are awarded, 100 of which must be spent in acquiring the Spirit state, while the remaining 50 may be spent choosing among Natural Abilities and Powers of Being Creation described in Chapter 26. The spellcaster also has a choice of 50 Development Points in disadvantages and penalties in order to get additional points. This spell will only work on Natural and Beings Between Worlds, therefore it cannot be cast upon spirits to increase their existing abilities. If a Spiritual being should reincarnate in a physical form, it automatically loses the advantages and benefits gained through this spell.</string>
    <string name = "spiritExistEff">+10 DP and +5 optional DP in disadvantages</string>

    <string name = "spiritCreate">Spirit Creation</string>

    <string name = "tieVitalEssence">Tie Vital Essence</string>
    <string name = "tieVitalEssenceDesc">This spell ties an individual\'s soul to a physical object without completely disengaging it from the original body. An individual affected by this cannot die from loss of Life Points. His body is still vulnerable to damage, including criticals that could be completely incapacitating, but he remains alive even after being reduced below the LP threshold that would normally kill him. Assuming the individual has access to some form of supernatural healing (which this spell does not provide), he can eventually recover from any amount of damage. This spell also renders the individual immune to all magical effects that directly affect his essence.\nIf the object tied to the soul is destroyed, the individual dies instantly. Furthermore, the individual and the object must forever remain within one kilometer of each other, or the bond breaks, killing the subject. The object used as the container cannot have a Presence higher than 30. Those wishing to resist the effects of this spell must pass a MR Check with a Difficulty of 100.</string>

    <string name = "greenness">Greenness</string>
    <string name = "greennessDesc">By merging his spirit with Nature itself, the spellcaster is able to create vegetal and animal life as he pleases within a ten-kilometer radius. Such life emerges instantly, regardless of local climate and terrain conditions. However, since the magical energy of this spell has no duration, the extended survivability of the newly created life is not guaranteed. Animals and plants created with this spell must belong to existing species.</string>

    <string name = "resurrect">Resurrection</string>
    <string name = "resurrectDesc">This spell snatches a soul from the Flow and returns it to life. Difficulty depends on the amount of time elapsed since death. The longer the period, the more the spirit has spread and attached to the Flow of Souls. The spell has the power to bring spirits back, but not to tie them to their body or to heal it. For a completely effective resurrection, the soul should be placed in a suitable body using the spell Transmigrate Soul. However, it is possible that the time elapsed may have produced irreparable damage on the soul, therefore it is up to the GM to put some limit on the subject\'s memories and knowledge. Destroyed or already reincarnated souls cannot be resurrected. Resurrected spirits cannot have a base Presence higher than 30, and the elapsed time since death must be less than one month.</string>
    <string name = "resurrectEff">+5 to the maximum Presence affected and twice the time elapsed since the subject\'s death</string>

    <string name = "soulLord">Lord of the Souls</string>

Among other uses, the caster can snatch a soul from a body and reintroduce it into an unborn child, thus controlling Nephilim birth.\nThe Lord of the Souls conveys his orders to those under his dominion via a mystical connection that does not require physical proximity or mutual language. Those wishing to resist the effects of this spell must pass a MR Check with a Difficulty of 120. A being who fails is entitled to a new check each day control is maintained, or any time it is given an order completely against its nature. If the caster is attempting to separate a soul from its original body, the target receives a +40 bonus to its MR Check. This spell does not affect undead.</string>
