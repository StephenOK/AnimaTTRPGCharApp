The stalled spell can be activated later, by any caster who pays the exact Zeonic cost with which the spell was cast. The spellcaster in possession of the objects is in full control of the spell as if he were the original caster, and he will even be allowed to pay for Maintenance, if applicable. The stalled spell may be reused as long as the same Zeonic cost is paid again. For example, an archmage could store a Zeonic-value 80 Fire Ball in a staff and give it to his apprentice, who could then use the staff to cast a Fire Ball every time he had 80 Zeonic points to spend.

    <string name = "prepareSpell">Prepare Spell</string>
    <string name = "prepareSpellDesc">This spell allows the caster to introduce a second spell inside an object or person, so that it can automatically be cast later, without preparation or accumulation. Prepare Spell must be cast at the same time as the spell it will affect. The prepared spell may be activated by the caster, the subject hosting it, or the bearer of the enchanted object. It uses the Magic Projection of the original caster, unless the bearer decides to use his own. Once cast, the spell vanishes. The maximum Zeonic value of the spell cannot exceed 100. If maintenance payment of Prepare Spell is discontinued, the second spell will be lost as well.

    <string name = "possession">Possession</string>
    <string name = "possessionDesc">This spell enables the caster to take control of another individual\'s body, temporarily relocating part of his spirit in the host. This allows the caster to use all the abilities of the invaded subject freely or his own. In this second case, the spellcaster uses the physical Characteristics and bonuses of the host. If the victim and the caster have very dissimilar bodies, the GM can apply a penalty between -20 and -40 on account of the difficulty involved in the change. The caster can decide to use either his own abilities or his host\'s every turn, but he cannot mix them at the same time. The spellcaster\'s body remains in a coma for as long as Possession is active. Non-Energy-damaging attacks will affect the possessed body only, whereas supernatural attacks will subtract Life Points from both. If the body in question is that of a creature with Damage Resistance, the caster suffers only one-tenth (or less, in case the creature has a Damage Resistance multiple higher than 10) of the damage received by the physical form. If the possessed body should die while the caster still has Life Points left, his spirit immediately returns to his original form. Avoiding the effects of the spell requires the victim to pass a MR Check with a Difficulty of 120.

    <string name = "sealDesc">Seal will stall a maintained Spiritual spell in someone, making it impossible for the target to be freed from its effects.

Conditioning must be cast at the same time as the spells it will affect. Each restricted spell may be subject to a different condition, but once set, a caster cannot make any changes at a later date\nThe conditioned spell automatically activates at the exact designated moment - even if the caster is unaware. For instance, a caster may condition Stop Fall to activate when falling from great heights. In the same way, a necromancer may condition Defeat Death to activate at the time of his death. Conditioned spells that have not been triggered require no maintenance. If the Conditioning spell itself disappears, all other spells linked to it also disappear. Any number of spells may be Conditioned as long as the total number of Zeon points is 100 or below. Only one Conditioning spell at a time may be kept active. Spell action will be Active or Passive depending on its own nature.</string>

    <string name = "linkMaintenanceDesc">The spellcaster may assign maintenance payment of one of his spells to somebody else, thus forcing the target to invest Zeon points unknowingly. Link Maintenance con only be used in persons with the Gift, or magical beings or objects. Characters wishing to avoid this spell need to pass a MR Check with a Difficulty of 120. Those individuals unaware of the fact that they are being targeted cannot roll again for Resistance.

Within this space, the caster has the power to prohibit any Active Action taken by any person or creature who does not pass a MR Check with a Difficulty of 140. This check must be repeated each round in which an Active Action is attempted, unless the caster chooses to allow the action to occur. Only Active Actions may be prohibited, so affected targets may still perform Passive Actions, such as repelling attack. In order to prohibit an action, the caster must be aware of it, so some individuals may be able to overcome the effects of this spell through deception or subterfuge. Prohibiting another\'s Active Action counts as a Passive Action for the caster. This spell\'s area of effect remains stationary.</string>

    <string name = "knowledgeGift">The Gift of Knowledge</string>

    <string name = "magicStrengthen">Strengthen Magic</string>
    <string name = "magicStrengthenDesc">This spell intensifies the power of the magic used by the caster, making his spells harder to destroy. As long as this spell is maintained, all other spells the caster performs are treated as having +50 Zeonic value. This increase is not actual Zeon, so it cannot provide any Added Effect bonuses, but it does make spells harder to destroy. For instance, a character casting Create Light with a Zeonic value of 30 while simultaneously maintaining Strengthen Magic would not see an increase in the Light spell, but if another character casts Destroy against him, the spell would have, to all practical purposes, a Zeonic value of 80 instead of 30.</string>

    <string name = "predestination">Predestination</string>
    <string name = "predestinationDesc">This spell allows the caster to modify future events according to his plan, thus predestining several circumstances in the future. The complexity of the events is left to the caster\'s own design. He may preordain one event, leaving the different small happenings that lead up to its realization to chance, or quite on the contrary, he may try to determine each one of the aspects involved in producing a final result. The spell is not meant to cause a completely impossible outcome. However, the odds are limited only by the caster\'s imagination. Preordained events may be set for a specific date or they may be scheduled to repeat eternally through time - solstices and leap years, for example.\nGiven the huge complexity of the spell, let\'s look at a few examples of what it could be used for: An imprecise Predestination would be a caster\'s prediction of misfortune befalling an entire family and their offspring, condemning all their members to a horrible death before reaching a certain age. On the other hand, should the caster wish to be more explicit, he could condemn their first born children to be murdered by wild wolves on the very night of their birth. Naturally, not all predestinations need to be negative; the caster might predestine a child to become a king.\nHowever, the future created by the spell is not absolute and inevitable; there is always the chance of preventing it from coming true. Anyone outside the limits preordained by the caster, that is, anyone passing the MR Check, can keep destiny from fulfilling itself. In order to neutralize the actions of third parties, the caster may plan ahead for some security measures inside the limits of the spell. A good example of this would be the inclusion of a clause stating that anyone who tries to thwart destiny will be murdered by wolves. Preventing this spell from working only requires that the person, creature, or object with the highest resistance of those directly affected by the spell passes a MR Check with a Difficulty of 140 at the time the spell is being cast. Those influenced by its effects will not be able to do anything to stop it from happening; chance will inevitably play against them in the most unavoidable of ways. The MR can be repeated only when some of the predestined events have come true. Therefore, the greater the detail, the greater the chances of preventing the event. If any of the preordained events should be stopped, the whole spell is cancelled.</string>
